# Household Inflation Expectations

**ECON 2020 — Final Project**  
**Title:** *The Predictive Power of Household Inflation Expectations*  
**Author:** Anu Verma

## Overview

This project investigates whether the distribution of household inflation expectations — sourced from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers — helps predict realized inflation in the United States.

While most forecasting models rely on professional or market-based expectations, this analysis focuses on the **first three moments** (median, variance, skewness) of household expectations and examines their predictive power for year-ahead inflation.

## Data Sources

- `Msurvey_1y_infl_exp.csv`: University of Michigan Survey of Consumers — downloaded from [SCA Data Archive](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/data-archive/mine.php)
- `moments.csv`: Computed moments (median, variance, skewness), generated by `scripts/moments_Msurvey.R`
- `cpi_yoy.csv`: Year-over-year CPI inflation data from FRED using API
- `mkt_inflation_cleaned.csv`: 1-year market-based inflation expectations from the [Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations)

## Methodology

### Step-by-step workflow to reproduce the analysis:

1. **Run the following scripts in `scripts/` to prepare inputs:**
   - `1y_distribution_density.R`: Generates the distribution density plot (`1y_inflation_density.png`)
   - `moments_Msurvey.R`: Computes survey moments and outputs `moments.csv`
   - `fred_cpi_data.R`: Fetches and saves CPI inflation data

2. **Run `main.R` to:**
   - Merge datasets and align time series
   - Plot inflation expectations from households and markets
   - Plot time series of forecast moments
   - Estimate and summarize baseline OLS regressions
